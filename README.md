About
This repository holds a client-style tool aimed at bypassing HWID restrictions and helping users recover access to systems that lock by hardware ID. The project focuses on runtime spoofing and identifier masking to present alternate identifiers to targeted software. Use this only on machines and accounts you own or with explicit permission.

Key features
- HWID spoofing engine with multiple profile slots.
- Runtime identifier swap for common hardware IDs.
- Profile import/export for reproducible setups.
- Unban assist tools designed for account recovery.
- Offline mode so identifiers revert on restart.
- Logging and session snapshots for troubleshooting.
- Simple GUI and compact CLI interface.

How it works (high level)
The tool intercepts calls that query hardware identifiers and supplies controlled values from the active profile. The process runs in user space and focuses on:
- network interface identifiers (MAC),
- disk serial references,
- BIOS and SMBIOS fields,
- common device IDs used by client anti-cheat modules.

The code uses replace-and-restore patterns. It keeps the original identifiers in memory and restores them when you stop the session. The design aims to reduce persistence and makes the change ephemeral. The project uses a layered approach:
- detection layer: finds the identifiers the target queries,
- mapping layer: maps those identifiers to profile values,
- injection layer: supplies the mapped values to the target process.

Download & run
Download the release file from the Releases page and execute it. The Releases page contains compiled packages and installers. Get the appropriate release for your OS, then run the distributed file to install or run the tool.

Install (short guide)
- Download the release package from the Releases link above.
- For installers: double-click the downloaded file and follow the prompts.
- For portable packages: extract to a folder and run the main executable.
- When the tool runs, create a profile, select the spoof targets, and start the session.

The installer sets up a safe folder for profiles and a logs folder for session traces. Profiles store a set of mapped identifiers and optional notes about the profile purpose.

UI & usage overview
The application exposes two interfaces: a basic GUI and a compact CLI. The GUI covers most workflows and presents settings in clear groups.

Main UI sections
- Dashboard: session status, active profile, start/stop control.
- Profiles: create, edit, import, export.
- Targets: choose which identifiers to spoof per profile.
- Logs: session logs, last-run snapshot, and export options.
- Settings: start-on-boot toggle, rollback on exit, update check.

Basic flow
1. Open Profiles and create a new profile.
2. Choose identifiers to spoof (MAC, disk, SMBIOS).
3. Apply values or generate new ones.
4. Return to Dashboard and start the session.
5. Confirm the target process reads the spoofed values.

CLI usage (example, conceptual)
- list profiles
- start <profile>
- stop

The CLI aims to automate tests and integrate with scripts that manage test environments.

Troubleshooting
- If a target process still sees the original HWID, try a different profile or enable expanded targets. Some anti-cheat modules probe unusual system fields.
- If the session fails to start, check that you run the tool with the same privilege level as the target process. A privilege mismatch can block interceptions.
- If the tool logs show missing hooks for a target, that likely means the targeted field uses a newer query method. Update the tool from Releases and retry.
- Use exported session snapshots when you open an issue so maintainers can reproduce the environment.

FAQ
Q: Does this persist after reboot?
A: Default mode keeps changes only while the session runs. The tool restores originals when you stop or reboot. You can enable a persistent profile, but the design favors ephemeral usage.

Q: Which OS does this support?
A: The project focuses on Windows 10/11 builds and offers a portable mode for testing environments. Check the Releases page for packaged builds.

Q: Is this open source?
A: The repository mix includes documentation and test harnesses. Some binaries in Releases are built artifacts. Check the repository tree for source modules and build scripts.

Q: Can I import profiles from other tools?
A: Yes. Profiles use a JSON schema so you can import and map values from supported formats.

Q: What if anti-cheat updates?
A: The tool uses modular detection. Update via Releases if target anti-cheat changes require new handling.

Safety and testing
The tool includes safe rollback behavior. It keeps a local snapshot before any changes. If you need to revert, stop the session or use the rollback option. The logs capture operations and let you inspect applied values.

Troubleshooting checklist
- Match privilege level between the tool and the target.
- Check for OS updates that might affect hooks.
- Verify that the target reads the same fields the tool covers.
- Try alternate generated identifiers if the target rejects a specific value.

Contributing
We welcome testers, bug reports, and code contributions. The repo uses standard GitHub pull request flow:
- Fork the repo.
- Create a feature branch.
- Run tests and ensure logging works.
- Submit a PR with a clear description and sample session snapshot if relevant.

When creating issues, include:
- OS and build.
- Release version from Releases.
- Profile export or session snapshot.
- Steps to reproduce.

Changelog and releases
Binary packages and installers live on the Releases page. Download and run the specific release that matches your OS and architecture. The Releases page documents changes per version and includes SHA256 checksums for each file.
